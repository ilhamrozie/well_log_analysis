# well_log_analysis

This repository included all the txt files, Jupyter notebook and final report of my well log analysis for Boonsville Field, TX during my undergraduate studies.
Pictures below demonstrated some of the visualizations of well logs including a triple combo log that is useful for well log analysis.
